## About this course

The purpose of this course is to provide _to practical knowledge and skills on "T24 programming"_ to help professionals working with T24 core banking system start solving some real challenges.

Programming experience in any other language is not a must, but it will help you to master the concepts that will be taught here on _"InfoBasic or jbc"_, the programming language of T24 core banking system.

This is a beginner to intermediate course. This means that some of the advanced concepts will not be discussed here. However the knowledge you will gain will help you understand _"T24 CBS"_ and how to solve real challenges.

> _The projects that will develop together will be relatively small but they will be solving real-world challenges. For some, this is going to be an opportunity to improve their knowledge of "finance and banking"._
